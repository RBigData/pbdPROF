=== Small jobs ===

* Clean up the vignette (it's a bit messy for my tastes).

* Unify the example code/plots in the vignette.

* Include pmclust profiler plots in the vignette.

* Fix legends on plots so that they are meaningful (rather than 
  factor(garbage))

* Expand the plot()/autoplot() documentation to better explain the different
  types of plots.

* plot documentation lists plot.type arguments incorrectly, and is generally 
  of poor quality.


=== Medium jobs ===

* which= in plot() is broken.


=== Not so small jobs... ===

* Build interface for TAU.

* Make a build that includes the mpiP source (including libunwind).
