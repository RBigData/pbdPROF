=== Small jobs ===

* Clean up the vignette (it's a bit messy for my tastes).

* Unify the example code/plots in the vignette.

* Include pmclust profiler plots in the vignette.

* Fix legends on plots so that they are meaningful (rather than 
  factor(garbage))

* Expand the plot()/autoplot() documentation to better explain the different
  types of plots.

* plot() documentation lists plot.type arguments incorrectly, and is generally 
  of poor quality.

* In plot(), plot.type="counts" is completely broken.

* in plot() with plot.type=stats1, "Number of Function Calls" should be an int

=== Medium jobs ===

* which= in plot() is broken.


=== Not so small jobs... ===

* Build interface for PAPI (do this before TAU)

* Build interface for TAU.

* Make a build that includes the mpiP source (including libunwind).

* There may perhaps be problems with profiling scalapack ...

* Profiling under Windows system is never working.
  fpmpi did claim working under MS-MPI.
