\section{Profilling}
This section talks about the profiling the text files received after runnning the Rscripts 
involving MPI calls.

\subsection{Profilling of fpmpi}
The below script will be used as first step towards profiling.
\begin{Code}

\begin{Output}
An fpmpi profiling object:
        Routine Calls     Time Data.Sent SyncTime
1 MPI_Allreduce    10 0.000107       188 0.000148
2   MPI_Barrier    21 0.003960         0 0.000000
