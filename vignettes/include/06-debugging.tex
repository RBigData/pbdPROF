\section{Problems with \pkg{pbdPROF}}
\label{sec:debug}


\subsection{Installation}

{\color{red}Problem 1:}  If you have downloaded the package from github and 
tried to using R CMD INSTALL \pkg{pbdPROF} and you see an error similar to this
\begin{Output}
ERROR: 'configure' exists but is not executable -- see the 'R Installation and Administration Manual'
\end{Output}
{\color{dkgreen}Solution:}  You have to make the configure executable which 
means giving it permission , which can done by
\begin{Code}
chmod +x configure
\end{Code}
after changing the folder to package's main directory.

{\color{red}Problem 2:}  If you are using \pkg{fpmpi}~\citep{fpmpi} externally 
and during it's installation you get an error similar to this
\begin{Output}
error :checking for library containing MPI_Init... (cached) no configure: 
error: Could not find MPI library
\end{Output}
{\color{dkgreen}Solution:} You probably need to specify the path to MPI library using this in command line in the fpmpi main directory
\begin{Code}
./configure CPPFLAGS="-fPIC -I/usr/lib/openmpi/include" LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib/openmpi/lib -lmpi"
\end{Code}



\subsection{Running}

{\color{red}Problem 1:}  While running \pkg{Rmpi} code for profiling, if you
encounter the error below:
\begin{Output}
error: mpiexec was unable to launch the specified application as it could not access
or execute an executable:
Executable: /path/to/R/package_installation_directory/2.15/Rmpi/Rslaves.sh
Node: "Your_node"
while attempting to start process rank 0.
\end{Output}
{\color{dkgreen}Solution:}  You need to make executable of the shell scripts in 
the "inst" directory of "Rmpi" main directory using the following command from 
command line in "inst" directory:
\begin{Code}
chmod +x *.sh
\end{Code}



{\color{red}Problem 2:}  While running \pkg{Rmpi} code for profiling, if you 
encounter the error below:
\begin{Output}
[G:12221] [[39704,0],0] ORTE_ERROR_LOG: Not found in file ../../../../../orte/mca/plm/base/plm_base_launch_support.c at line 758
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
mpiexec was unable to start the specified application as it encountered an error.
More information may be available above.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
\end{Output}
{\color{dkgreen}Solution:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You need to check whether your \pkg{Rmpi} is working without the \pkg{pbdPROF}.If yes try running your \pkg{Rmpi} code on single process only.
\item If above does not help, then you may need .Rprofile in Rmpi/inst/ to run your code from "inst" directory.
\item If still your code does not run ,you need to update your OPENMPI version to the latest one.You can check your openmpi version\url{http://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/} through 
\begin{Output}
ompi_info
\end{Output}
\item If further you came to this far and luck is not with you somehow(pun intended), there might some configuration problem in your machine.
\end{enumerate}
